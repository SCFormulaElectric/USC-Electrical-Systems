- I would move the frequency inputs on the STM32 to timer 1 channel pins so that SW team can use input capture direct mode for easier / more accurate code, you can check what the pinout is for that
- it'd help to fix the directionality of the labels for better readability
- ESD protection on more of the inputs required
- I would lower the charge_on_3.4V voltage. in general I don't think its wise to do anything above VDD though the pins may be tolerant
  also the charge_on signal is supplied by a little rectifier in the charge cart that may go above 12V (double check the actual rectifier specs)
  in any case you have quite a bit of room to lower the voltage
- The PC error implementation contradicts with the note that it should be pulled low
  it is pulled to 3.3V on this board but the gate is pulled to groudn on the relay board, don't think that will work
- also the relay board already has a 47 ohm series resistor, not sure if You intended for that
- need to select fuse for LV
 


- layout- esd diodes should be close to their ocnnector pin
- for this board, the SDC traces do not carry high currents (it branches off the main SDC current path) so it can be skinny
- I would still rearrange some things on the board to make the routing better / shorter, maybe flip the connector for ex
- oscillator routing should be done more carefully- see this https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/Appnotes/Atmel-8128-Best-Practices-for-the-PCB-Layout-of-Oscillators_ApplicationNote_AVR186.pdf
- generally do not do long traces of ground without via into the plane, it defeats the prupose of the plane
  also try to do 1 via per component so each component has a low impedance path to ground and doesn't share noise
- don't be afraid to do more planes, I usually like to have a 3.3V plane I feel like that would help here
