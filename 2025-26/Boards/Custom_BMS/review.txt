Arda review notes

- Isolation line should go over D2
- Input cap on 3.3V regulator
- Uart1 traces in power plane
- Copper pour on bottom of bms chip
- Remove cell tap vias


Pi review notes:
- change LDO cap to 100n, since most designs use that
- LDOIN resistor sized improperly (too much based on 4 cell configuration)
  Suggest having 2 separate resistor values to switch between
  Use 20mA startup current as peak current in calculations
- ensure good heat sinking for power resistor and BJT for LDOIN
- add all 3D components
- each signal layer should have GND Plane, and separate power and signal with ground plane
- ground return vias next high speed signal vias
- add buck converter feedback node test point

Arda review notes:

- Filter resistor value on BAT pin - "[30 Ohms] must be used for hot-plug performance"
- I believe C24 should be connected from CB16 to BAT not CB_TOP to BAT
- Datasheet recommends assuming a 2V drop Vc-Ve, so upper bounds of Rnpn should be smaller
- Fuse not specified
- Sure you want to use 10k with the thermistors, if we're using enepaq ones then they recommend 680 but idk
- Shouldn't the motherboard also have isolation capacitors, in addition to its common-mode choke? 
- Control pilot not connected on connector, missing 3.3 to 12V step up
- SPI_RDY should ideally be connected to MCU (pg. 3) 
- Noisy and quiet grounds recommended to be kept separate then reconnected on a lower layer 
 "to ensure best performance" (pg. 206-207) [optional]
- Separate wire recommended for BAT pin and top VC pin, also AVSS and VC0 to avoid device current creating IR error (Pg. 208)
 could add 2 pins for those on the connector

- Would be nice to have connectors for power, thermistors, CAN, and misc. GPIO + J1772 stuff
- D18 seems unnecessary
- Q6 should have ESD protection unless you can guarentee safe handling
- Proximity detect and control pilot should be wired to MCU so we can know when we're plugged in and
  the max current the EVSE can provide so we don't trip the breaker
- Also if we're using proximity detect it should be powered on the BMS side
- I think the minimum number of cells is 6 (Pg. 5, Pg. 23, 9.3.2.1.1.1)

Arda review notes:

- Proximity detect voltage divider doesn't divide enough (4.5V to MCU)
- Reference voltage seems a little high on the comparator considering the signal swings from 0 to ~8.3V
- Via holes with 0.2mm present, that costs a little more on JLC
