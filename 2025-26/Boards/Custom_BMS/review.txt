Layout review notes 
10-18-2025

- Isolation line should go over D2
- Input cap on 3.3V regulator
- Uart1 traces in power plane
- Copper pour on bottom of bms chip
- Remove cell tap vias


Pi review notes:
- change LDO cap to 100n, since most designs use that
- LDOIN resistor sized improperly (too much based on 4 cell configuration)
  Suggest having 2 separate resistor values to switch between
  Use 20mA startup current as peak current in calculations
- ensure good heat sinking for power resistor and BJT for LDOIN
- add all 3D components
- each signal layer should have GND Plane, and separate power and signal with ground plane
- ground return vias next high speed signal vias
- add buck converter feedback node test point
