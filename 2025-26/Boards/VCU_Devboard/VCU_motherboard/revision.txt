Revision notes

Arda 12-30-2025 -> Tim 1-1-2026:
- Grounds missing on bottom resistor of analog input voltage divider
    - Added grounds
- Should C4 and others be connected to ground instead of in series, seems they're DC blocking.
    - Corrected, now connected to ground
- I couldn't find a 1941 ohm resistor on digikey (R22)
    - Switched voltage divider to 1k/2k 5V -> 3.333V instead of the previous 3.3V
- Love the op amp choice
    - :D
- USB ESD ground pin should be pin 2
    - Corrected
    - Also moved ESD pin 5 before voltage divider
- Vbus voltage divider seems a little high (3.56V vs max pin voltage of 3.6V)
    - Lowered divider to 4.7k/10k; 5V -> 3.401V
    - Current draw = V/R = 5/(14.7k) = 340uA
- 4.7uF cap on USB Vbus seems excessive given that nothing is powered off of Vbus
    - Unchanged, Vbus cap falls within USB 2.0 specs (1uF to 10uF) for device
- Digital outputs not connected to MCU
    - Connected, labeled MCU connections "_gate"
- I would pick another 12-5V buck converter, from a big brand like TI
    - switched to TPS5430DDA, 3A 
- Reverse polarity MOSFET not specified
    - Chose AOD4184A: logic level, 40V rating
- DC power connector connected to 12V instead of EX 12V
    - Unchanged (Needs clarification), EX 12V passes through fuse and reverse-polarity IC into the safe +12V flag
- Need to be careful of ESR of output capacitor on LDO to make sure its in the stable region
    - Added a 470mO series resistor (total ESR now between 47mO and 1 ohm)
- MCU needs oscillator for CAN
    - Chose the same one from lora board
- RTC chip needs oscillator, can also provide clk to MCU too through clkout pin I believe
    - Removed RTC, mcu comes with peripheral, decided to use that
- RTC chip needs backup power supply to maintain time (battery or supercapacitor)
    - Connected battery cell holder to mcc's VBAT, mcu handles RTC
- Needs overcurrent protection
    - Added fuse
- IMU is obsolete (no longer manufactured)
    - Switched to LSM6D3
- IMU labels mix I2C with SPI, if SPI is used the label should be SCLK
    - Corrected labels SPI,
    - SPI is used currently but may not be necessary, would be nice to know layout for future digital sensors
- I believe I2C SDA is on PB7, not PB5
    - RTC removed
- Reset button missing
    - Added reset button 
- STM needs more decoupling capacitors, 100nF on every VDD pin + 1uF on one of the VDD pins
    - Added decoupling capacitors

Tim 1-4-2026: 
Redesigned op-amps for more standard resistor values & smaller capacitors
Added tlv9062 (2 op-amps in 1 IC) footprints
Added resistor and capacitor footprints for micro-sd card
Bumped up micro-sd card capacitor to 10uF
Fixed 3.3V flag

Ti 1-5-2026:
Added OTG footprints
Note: 4.7uF capacitor maybe could be smaller based on minimum 1uF, parts use 0603 sizing
4.7uF capacitor rated for 16V, (vbus max 5v)
Switched voltage divider to 10k/20k
USB AB connector; https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/molex/0475900001/1832254
0402 sizing for stm32 Vdd capacitors 
Switched mcc's VCAP sizes up to 0603 for a higher voltage rating (6.3V increased to 16V)
Switched oscillator to 32khz w/ same capacitance

SPI pins checked against CubeIDe's assignment
Interrupt was switched with chip select, corrected 

1-6-2026:
Sectioned off boards by function (roughly)
Dev Board
    - Circuits are standard and have been tested on other boards
IO Board
    - Analog & Digital Inputs, Digital Outputs
    - Perhaps digital IO can be moved to Dev Board
    - This gives room for swapping out analog filters
    - Main concerns are op-amps might fry, and active filter may not be necessary for most sensors
Power Board
    - This allows for 12V testing w/o worry of frying anything on board
Datalogging Board
    - Micro-SD Card Connector & USB OTG
    - I think these circuits are a first so there may be issues that need to be corrected
