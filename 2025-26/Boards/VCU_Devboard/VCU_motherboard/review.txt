Review notes

Arda 12-30-2025:
- Grounds missing on bottom resistor of analog input voltage divider
- Should C4 and others be connected to ground instead of in series, seems they're DC blocking.
- I couldn't find a 1941 ohm resistor on digikey (R22)
- Love the op amp choice
- USB ESD ground pin should be pin 2
- Vbus voltage divider seems a little high (3.56V vs max pin voltage of 3.6V)
- 4.7uF cap on USB Vbus seems excessive given that nothing is powered off of Vbus
- Digital outputs not connected to MCU
- I would pick another 12-5V buck converter, from a big brand like TI
- Reverse polarity MOSFET not specified
- DC power connector connected to 12V instead of EX 12V
- Need to be careful of ESR of output capacitor on LDO to make sure its in the stable region
- MCU needs oscillator for CAN
- RTC chip needs oscillator, can also provide clk to MCU too through clkout pin I believe
- RTC chip needs backup power supply to maintain time (battery or supercapacitor)
- Needs overcurrent protection
- IMU is obsolete (no longer manufactured)
- IMU labels mix I2C with SPI, if SPI is used the label should be SCLK
- I believe I2C SDA is on PB7, not PB5
- Reset button missing
- STM needs more decoupling capacitors, 100nF on every VDD pin + 1uF on one of the VDD pins
