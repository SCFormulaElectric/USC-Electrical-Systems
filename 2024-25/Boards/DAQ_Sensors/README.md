# Relay Board Documentation

## High-level Functionality:

The DAQ sensor board takes in various sensor data, both analog and digital, and converts it to all digital signals that can be sent and processed by the main DAQ on the RPi.
This is done through various ADCs and multiplexers, which cycle through signals to be sent to the DAQ.
